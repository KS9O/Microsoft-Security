# Domain Vs. Workgroup

## Domain

Central Management: One or more servers manage and control all computers and users.

Users are stored in a central database and can log on from any computer in the domain

Domain once youre authorized you dont need to keep logging in.

## Workgroup

Default settings for windows
computers are self-managed

users are stored in a local database in each computer.

Work groups you need credientials everytime you log in

# Domain Concepts

Domain Controllers (DCs) control access to resources in a domain.

Servers that are domain members have resource access managed by a DC.

Client authentication is managed by the DC, it checks what priviledges we have and if we are in the database.

# Active Directory & Domains


the first domain created in Active Directory (AD) forest is called the FOREST ROOT DOMAIN

Trust between domains allow users and resources in one domain to be shared in another.

In a single forest, all domains share a common schema and global catalog.

# Main Capabilites & Roles

1. ## Active Directory Domain Services ( AD DS)

Database system that provides authentication, directory services, policies, and other services in a Windows enviroment

Any Domain user with the privildeges can add computers to a domain, privileges can be added via group policy.

WorkStations can be added to the domain as shown in Control panel, not all OS versions can be added to domain

## AD Promotion
join exisiting domains or create a new one, set a password for DSRM for recovery purposes, view script enables you to configure the installation scrit that runs via powershell

supports LDAP protocol

2. ## Domain name system (DNS)




3. ## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)





4. Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)






5. File Server ( FS)


## Kahoot Practice

Windows Nano Server has a reduced attack surface.   it doesnt have a increased resource utilization, a graphical interface or increased overhead.

The first domain is referred to as the "root domain"

Workgroups are easier to manage for large enterprises, this is false, windows and pc host are automatically default in a workgroup, we have to actually redo that in active directory, they dont scale very well with large groups, this is why they adopt active directory 

the domains under the root domain is the child domain.
