## GPO Introduction


## What Are GPOs Used For?

Group  Policy Objects (GPOs)  are typically used for the following purposes:

Security settings:
its the main purpose,  it manages our desktops/users

Desktop  Management

Remote application deployment

Network configuration

Services


## Policies  Vs. Preferences

policies can't be changed,  prpeferences can change tempporarlily

## Policies  

1. Enforce registry keys and values
2.  Users lack the ability to  change specific  settings
3. Can only be changed by authorized administrator

## Preferences  

1.  Set defaults for aplications and the user environment
2.  Allow users to  edit, reove, or change settings.
3. Authroized administrator may  change default; user can change specifics.

##  Group Policy  Functionality

GPOs have preset configurable policies

Make use of cient-side extensions (CSE)

GPOs use CSE to rocess settings on the cclient side

Default update time is 90 minutes but can be set manually or refreshed immediately

# Group Management

## Group Policy Management Console

Group ppolicies have a hierarchiccal structure

New obkects  are  linked to an OU (orginaztional unit)  or domain level.

The Default Domain Policy is  linked on  the  dommain level.

## Grouup  Policy  Proccessing  Order

Proccessing  order is significant

Where settings conflict across  policies, the last  applied will be configured.

GPO link order can modify  the  default proccessing  order  shown

GPO is good because we can use the OU  and specifically  apply changes to the OU.

Local Policy
goes into

Site
goes into

Domain
goes into

OU

## Group Policy Link Order

GPO link order 1 has the highest precedencce and is processed last.

Processed last means  its settings will apply above other policies.

Computer policies will be aplied above all other user olicies described earlier.

## Group Policy Inheritance

Inheritance:GPO linked to higher-level OU applies to  lower-level O.

GPO  processing  follows the behavior covered earlier.

GPO enforced (no override), blocking, or unlinking can affect this behavior.

## GPO Block, Enforce & nlink

Block:Inheritance of GPO settings from higher-level OU is stopped.

Enforce (No Override): High-level OU forces its settings on lower-lelvel O

Unlink: Default Processing order does not appply to GPO for OU.

## Security & WMI Filtering

Security Filteringg: GGPO will apply to users, grous, or computers.

WMI  Filtering: GPO aplies to machine characteristics , sch as OS, device hardware, or UUID (universal uniqe identifier)

GPO will not be appplied if user or commputer doesn't  match the filter.


# Group Policy Management Editor

## Editing a GPO

GPO's are edited  in the Group Policy Managemment  Editor.

this is where we tell the GPO what we are editing 

There are two levels of configuration

1. Computer Configuration
in a group policy 

2. User Configuration

## Editing Options


Software installation at the user and computer levels

we can set scripts to run at specific times

and  enforce  assword policies

## Event Viewer

this provides detailed information on grouup policy events
including in every windows OS environment

#  Additional GPO Configuration

## Script Node

Can be applied  to compters and users

Exected upon startuupp, login, shutdown, and logoff

Various script languages can be assigned.

## Managing Logon Scripts

START and SHUTDOWN scripts run before logon and logoff scripts.

STARTUP and SHUTDOWN run as system accounts and have the highest-level privileges, while LOGON and LOGOFF run w/ ser permissions.

Each script may  slow down the computers  startup or shutdown process

## Restricited Group

Assign AD users or group to local  groups on computers

Can restrict a user or group to special privileges only for specific hosts

overwrites group assignees

## Local Administrator Remmote Assignment

Restricted groups are created as a regular GPO and are set under the computer configuration,

Restricted groups are part of the security settings

One of the main uses is delegating admministrative rights to certain users on local machines

# WMI Filters & Troubleshooting

##  Windows Management Instrumentation Filters

A feature that works w/ the OU  hardware and OS

Policies can be appied based on  specific  macchine-related  parameters. 

WMI filters require a special query code.

## WMI Example

The excample on the right shows the code for a WMI that checks the OS version and architecture.

## Group Policy Modeling

Built-in tool used for troubleshooting and viewing policy usage details

it requires a domain name and DC

## Troubleshooting

Applied policies can be verified in the client.

gpresult \r displays policies applied on the computer and account.

## Additonal GPO Extensions
##          Extra

## GPO Extension Usage

Additional extensions can be added to the group policy

google chrome can be integrated w/ GPOs

GPOs are linked to windows os via ADM and ADMX files

ADM = file template used by microsofy group policies software to specify the location of reistry-based policy settings in the registry file. it is used by system administrators to define the policy for managing a group of computers that are part of the group, this info becomes part of the GPOs that are created for management of the group.

ADMX = XML-based files that provide registry-based settings to the group policy editor, they enable you to choose the particular group policy settings you wish to implement.

## Kahoot  Review

GPO Is 90 minutes

Default domain policy linked is under domain, cyber.local

Unlessed forced, policies applied at doman, site , or ou level are not inherited by child containers is false, we can bypass these policies.

 how to manually refresh group polcy is gpupdate
