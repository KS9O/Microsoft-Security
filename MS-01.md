# IP Address
An IPv4 address is
composed of four
numbers divided by
dots.
Each number is called
an octet.
The value of each
octet can be between
0 and 255.

# Network Classes
1. Class A 
255 0 0 0
Network Host Host Host
2. Class B
255 255 0 0
Network Network Host Host
3. Class C
255 255 255 0
Network Network Network Host

Subnetting is a logical way
of grouping IP addresses
in a network.
It helps determine the
network scope (from IP to
IP).
The three main types
(classes) of networks are
class A, class B, and
class C.

It helps determine the network scope (from IP to IP)
Every Octet uses the same position. mulitply by 2

1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128

A subnet masks contiouns 1's or 0's

A 1= Networkbit, A 0= Host Bit

# Private IP Addresses

cant be used directly to communicate over internet

## Static Ip Address: 
servers have static IP Address, A DNS number that doesnt change.
most networking gear has a static ip, DHCP this is how users get it.

## Default Gateway
Only neccessary when communicating to a network that isn't on a local network. A gate through which data passes on its way and/or to other networks. Usually are routers, computers, firewalls, proxys, and servers.

# DNS & DHCP
## Domain Name System (DNS)
Name to a # (IP ADDRESSES) Mappping
Typically installed on the domain controller (DC)
## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
Network management protocol
Dynamically assigns an IP address/other network-configuration parameters.

## VM Network Adapters
In NAT mode you can't access other VM hosts
1. Bride mode connects VM to talk to home network
2. Internal mode, isolated internal virutal network this works great w/ active directory


# Windows Client

Client: used for work/recreation

Server: Provides services for clients and their management.

dir is for directory

copy:
move:
mkdir: make directory 
rmdir: remove directory

## CMD Users & Groups

net user

net localgroup
