# Active Directory

## Windows Authentication Concepts

Identification ( who ), authentication ( proving who you are), and authorization ( who you are allows access to resources)

Some accounts will have more privileges than others (administrator, user , guest, etc.)

Users will only have access to resources within their local, domain, or active directory security context.


## Active Directory ( AD )

A directory service developed by Microsoft to manage domain environments

A hierarchical organization structure that stores objects such as users, groups, and devices

A tree consists of domains with the same name spaces that establish trust by default (transitive)

A forest consists of trees that share directory configuration and security boundaries ( trust must be configured)

## AD Domain Services

Hosted on domain controllers

Domain services control access to resources contained within domains or from trusted domains

Active Directory facilitates this access across domains

AD DS = Active Directory Domain Services

DC = Domain Controller

## AD Users & Computers ( ADUC)

ADUC is a tool that manages Active Directory objects, including users, computers, groups, OUs, and attributes.

OUs are container objects used to organize and contain users, groups, and computers, and apply uniform policies.

Can be integrated w/ third-party interfaces

OU = Organizational Unit

## Sites & Services

Sites represent physical network structures or topologies

Store network topology information, such as sites, subnets, and site link objects

Enable efficient replication of topologies

How a client finds a DC located closest to them

## Domains & Trusts

Trusts are required to access resources between domains

Trusts are required for providing access to some resources to another domain ( and perhaps restricting access to other domains)

Must still configure user/group access from one domain to another after trust is established.

## Certificate Services

On the internet, X.509 certificates allow for encrypted, verifiable communcations and authentication ( SSL/TLS, SFTP, SSH), thus supporting confidentality and integrity

Within a domain, they add another layer of security to domain resources.

Require additional configuration and management of the certificate life cycle ( creation, revocation, etc.)

# Active Directory Objects

Everything in AD is an object!, printers computers, etc.


## Active Directory USers

When creating a user: 

1. Some fields are mandatory
2. Some fields are optional 
3. Additional options can be set after the wizard is completed.

## Profiles

Profiles allow users to maintain their desktop and home folder configurations.

Local profiles are tied to a specific device or computer

Roaming profiles can be applied to any device on a domain.


Kahoot Answers

OU =  Organizational Unit
 
 
  A Certificate is an electronical form of authentication

Domain service is the main service in active directory,  which is true. Its mostly why its even used.
