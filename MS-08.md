# File Sharing

## Server Message Block (SMB )

* Peer-topeer (P2P) protocol
* Used to share resources over the network
* Port 445

## Access Process

Authentication into authorization

Accessing a shared resource requires authentication and permission-based authorization,

## File Sharing Method

* Sharing can be across a domain
*Dedicated Storage should be allocated
* Shared folders are managed via the **server manager tool**.
* Location syntax \\Machine_Name\Share_name

## File Sharing Method

* File sharing uses SMB
* Default administrative shared folders: 
* **Admin$**
* **C$**
* Default DC Shared Folders:
* **SYSVOL**
* **NETLOGON**

## Sharing Commands 

**net share** displays mappled, shared network folders.

net share shared=c:\share /grant:johnd,full

**net share [assigned_share_name]=[share_path]** assigns a name to the new shared network path.

net share c:\share /delete

**net share sharename /delete** removes a shared network path.

## Mapped Drive 

* A mapped drive in windows 7 is displayed similarly to a local drive w/ a assigned letter

it resembers a shortcut pointing to a drive located on a remote machine.

## Mapping Network Drives

net use z: \\machine_name\share_name persistent:yes

Maps a network shared path to an endpoint
net use [drive letter] [folder path] persistent:yes/no

## Hidden Shared Folders

Hidden folders do not appear in lists w/ other shared folders, folders can be hidden by adding a dollar sign (**$**) to the end of the name, they can be accessed via their specific paths.

# NTFS Permissions

## NTFS Overview

 * New Technology File System (NTFS) is a Windows
file system.
*  NTFS manages file and folder access.
* Files inherit permissions from their parent folders.
* Inheritance can be disabled.

## File System Comparison


## FAT: 
basic file system, maximum file size: 4gb, did not support encryption, offered only network security, did not support fault tolerance 

## NTFS:
 Provides auditing/journaling, maximum file size 16tb+, supports encryption, supports local/network security, supports fault tolerance.


 ## Permission Types

 * Read = Read Folder Contents
 * Write = write to folder contents
 * Execcute = View and run executable files, including scripts.
 * List Folder Content = View and list files/ subfolders
 * Modify = Read, write, and delete files/folders.
 * Full Control = Read, write, change, and delete files and subfolders. Users can also change permission settings for all files and subdirectories.(ADMIN)

 ## Deny Permission

 * File access can be denied, deny permission overrides grant permission

 Users are always granted the most restrictive permission when two methods ( NTFS and sharing) are used together.

 This illustration is another example of restrive file permission access when NTFS and sharing are used together.


 # Extra: Distributed File System ( DFS )

 ## DFS Overview

 * Provides a single hierarchical namespace, groups server shares into logical namespaces, replicates folders across multiple servers and sites.

 ## DFS Roles

 * DFS roles need to be installed, there are 2 DFS Roles

 1. DFS namespace
 2. DFS replication

 ## DFS Namespace

 DFS supports standalone or domain-based namespaces, DFS topology data is tored in the active directory. A DFS tree structure is constructed from one or more **root targets** and **DFS links**

 **Namespace Server** : provides the namespace and can be a computer or DC

 **Namespace Root** Shares all public folders and controls DFS settings.

 IF the domain name is cyber.com and the name of the root is public, the name space path will be \\cyber\public.

 ## Folder Target

 Shared folder universal naming convention (UNC) path, can also be a path to an associated namespace, data stored in the folder target.

 ## DFS Replication

 Replicates only the changed file blocks, supports the rebuilding of corrupt databases without unexpeted data loss.


## Kahoot Review

what port does SMB use, it is 445

NTFS Permission of deny will override any allow permissions, this is true.

Characterist of ntfs, it supports encryption
