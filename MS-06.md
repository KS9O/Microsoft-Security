# Introduction

## Understanding IP

Ip is the main protocol for computer communication

The protocol has two versions: IPv4 and IPv6

## IPv4 Private Addresses 

Class A Network: /8 prefixes

Class B Network: /16 prefixes

Class C Network: /24 prefixes

## Reserved IPv4 Addresses

loopback (127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255) this is used for communiction self-tests

APIPA (169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254): Self assigns IPs when DHCP is unavailable

Network Address ( i.e., 10.0.0.0/8) The first address in a network is reserved for use by the network

Broadcast Address (i.e., 10.255.255.255/8): the last address in a network is reserved for broadcast to the entire network.

# What is DHCP

Dynamically assigns IP addresses 

Automates client configuration

can be implemented in small or large LANS

## Benefits of DHCP

## DHCP

IP addresses are assigned automatically upon computer startup.

Correct configuration information is ensured

client configuration is updated automatically

A common source of network issues is eliminated

## Manual ( Static ) IP Configuration

IP addresses are entered manually for each computer

IP addresses may be entered incorrectly

May result in communication and networking issues

Changes in computer locations involve additional administrative effort

# DHCP Dora Process

## Discovery 

The client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message

## Offer

DHCP repies with a DHCPOFFER

## Request

The client broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST

## ACK 

The server broadcasts a DHCPACK message ( acknowledgement) 

## DHCP Lease Renewal Process

1. Lease time
2. Renewal process
3. Renewal attempt

# DHCP Installation

Go to Server mananger > manage > add roles & features

in the roles list, check the DHCP server role and click next

after wizard click install, wait for end

## Post-Deployment Configuration

AFter install the server must be authorized in the AD using an enterprise admin group member

DHCP authorization registers the DHCP server serve in the AD domain environment

DHCP authorization creates two new security groups, DHCP administrators and DHCP users

## DHCP Configuration


## Scope Impletementation: IP Address Range

The DHCP scope has a range of valid IP addresses that can be assigned to clients via leasing.

After install, go Tools> DHCP, and in teh DHCP console, expand IPV4 and right click NEW SCOPE

in scope wizard, enter a name for the scope

## Sope Implementation: IP Address Range

Define the first and last IP addresses and the subnet.

Am exclusion removes an IP address or range from the pool of addresses the DHCP server assigns.

Lease time is eight days by default but can be modified. 

With a large network, the lease can be extended to reduce network traffic.



On the  Router  default gateway ) screen, enter  the ip address gateway  clients should use,, then click add and  next.   

configure the DNS otions that clients  will use via DHCP. you can have as many dns servers as you need, but there should be at least two for redundancy.

enter the name of your domain and click next to apply DHCP configuration

## DHCP Reservations

Reservations help ensure that important servers ( servers, printers, etc. ) have fixed addresses.

Ip reservation is based on the devices mac address

## DHCP Security Filters

DHCP can filter clients based on MAC addresses to allow or deny IP distribution

The deny list takes precendence over the allow list

## DHCP Configuration Summary

Opem CMD from the Run window or start menu

the command line , ipconfig /all 

DHCP configuration summary is displayed, including the lease time and the IP of the DHCP server,

ipconfig /release : command removes the current IP configuration

ipconfig /renew: sends a request to the DHCP server to assign a new IP address.



## Kahoot.it  Review
 
APIPA 169.254.0.1 means theres an issue from dhcp server and host, you wont be able to get a number.

DHCP can address ipv6? it is true you can address upv4 and ipv6

The last address in a netowrk or subnet is reserved for broadcast traffic, its the first or last address that is reserved.

DHCP attempts to renew when it is 50% of the lease is up.

When creating a DHCP reservation, MAC address is used
