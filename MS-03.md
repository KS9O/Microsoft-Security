# DNS Fundamentals

## DNS Overview

Started w/ a single file, HOSTS, but it was not enough

considered critical infrastructure for the internet 

provided host name to ip address resolution, then and now.

## DNS Functions

Translates IP addresses to name

Web ( google.com) and email addresses (@gmail.com) accessed by name

Attackers endeavor to subvert DNS, as demonstrated next.

## DNS Structure

![Alt text](../../CyberSecurity%20Class/MicroSoft%20Security/MS-03/domain%20name%20sapce.PNG)

Domain name space consists of administrative zones and subzones

Zones can be delegated to specific DNS servers to maintain records.

Root servers handle top-level domains (TLDs) including root (emply string), .com, ..mil, .org, etc.

Sub-domain examples would be google.com, CNN.com

## DNS Root Servers

![Alt text](../../CyberSecurity%20Class/MicroSoft%20Security/MS-03/dns%20root%20servers.PNG)

Root servers are authoritative for the DNS root zone holding TLDs.

Authoritative servers answer as the original source of a DNS client query.

Non-authoritative servers act as a go-between, or resolver, to provide answers.

## DNS Resolution & Queries

![Alt text][def]

## Recursive

DNS server asks other DNS servers on behalf of the client.

## Iterative

The client directly asks each server until the request is satisfied.

## DNS Security Vulnerabilities

DNS is inherently unsecure.

Resolvers is unable to verify the authenticity of responses.

Attacker pretends to be a DNS server  (the source DNS server IP can be spoofed).

DNS cache-posoning points to a malicious website.

## DNS Security & DNSSEC

DNSSEC is a DNS extension that provides defense against common attacks, including those listed on the last slide.

Uses digital signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI) cryptography

DNS leverages PKI to authenticate responses so we know where it came from.

DNSSEC ensures the intergrity of responses, checking that they were not modified in transit.

## DNS Lookups & Tools

Forward lookups

Search a name to find an IP Address, cmd = nslookup

Reverse lookups

search an IP address to find a name.

Tools/CMD's

nslookup, ping, and Dig (download from ISC)

a forward lookup is when we type a domain name, etc like microsoft.com 

reserve lookup is when we know the ip address but not the domain name.

# DNS Zones & Records

## Record Types

A Record: the most common record, responsible for IPv4 translation

MX Record: Specifies an SMTP email server for the domain, which routes outgoing emails to their destination.

SRV Record: Used to identifty the host name and port number of servers that provide specific services.

NS Record: Represents the authoritative name server and provides the address of the server.

PTR Record: Reverse-loopup pointer that allows provision of an IP address and receives a host name.

CNAME Record: Points to another host name and iused as an alias.

# Zone Types

## Forward lookup zone

Name-to-IP mapping

Contains A, CNAME, MX and other records.

## Reverse lookup Zone

IP-to-name mapping

Contains PTR records.

## Primary & Secondary Zones

Can have both read and write permissions

A secondary zone can also be used on othger DNS servers to improve security and performance

A secondary zone is a read-only zone.

## Stub Zone

Contains only records necessary to identify the authoritative DNS for that Zone.

Done for performance and private namespaces

Includes: SOA, NS, and host records

IP addresses of authoritative DNS servers.

## DNS & Active Directory

DNS can integrate w/ AD

The combination provides an oiption for secure, dynamic updates.

AD automatically updates records when hosts are added to it, adding a client to a domanin, for instance.
