# Host Encryption

## Encryption

Scrambles computer info, encryption algorithms use large numbers called keys, keys are used to encrypt (scramble) and decrypt (unscramble) data.

Symmetric (shared key) * This is a single key, symmetric = single key * and asymmetric (public/private key) encryption utilizes many available algorithms and methods.

## Encrytion Effect

* Encryption can be implemented on any piece of data 

* encrypion strength depends on its key length 

* AES is a commonly used encryption algorithm

Key Lengths: 128, 192, 256

## BitLocker

* **Built in**: Preinstalled in Windows 10; provides a disk encryption for the OS, Enterprise/pro versions only

* **Encryption** use AES encryptions with a support for key lengths of 128 and 256

* **Features** Provides a pre boot protection, network unlock, GUI, and powershell management

## BitLocker Activation

* Bitlocker can be initiated by a windows client/server
* Activation of BitLocker may require a request for a policy change.
* The inital policy is * require additional authenticiation at step up*

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

* A microcontroller embedded in the system, designed to provide hardware security
* Generates cryptographic keys
* Used for BitLocker key protection

# AppLocker

## AppLocker Overview

* Provides the ability to restrict software
* Restriction is based on predefined runles
* can restrict multiple apps w/ a single rule
* Operates in Windows Enterprise editions

## Application Identity

Application identity is a policy used to identify applications.

The policy should be set to **automatic** for any applocker usage

this setting enforces activation of applocker in applications

We do this in GPO ( Group Policy Manager)

* Executable =.exe
* Windows installer = .msi, .msp, .mst
* Script = .ps1, .bat, .cmd, .vbs, .js
* Packaged App = .appx
* DLL = .dll

## AppLocker Default Rules

Predefinied empty AppLocker rules are provided in files, default rules can be added in each file, the deafult runes ensure that the files funcotion properly in the windows system

## Rule Conditions

* **Publisher** : Uses the apps digital signature for identification
* **path** : uses the apps location in the file system for identification
* **file hash** : identifies a file by a generated hash.

# Windows Firewall

## Windows Firewall Overview

* Provides network traffic protection
* Enables program integration
* Enables exception configuration

## Firewall Functionality

Firewalls analyze packets that enter the system. They then determine if the packet should be allowed or denied, firewall rules can be customized.

## Firewall Rules

* **inbound Rules** : Rules that manage incoming traffic, stuff coming into the host
* **outbound rules** : Rules that manage traffic generated in the system and sent out of the system.

## Rule Configuration

* Each rule can be turned on/off
* Rules can be opened and modified
* IP and user filtering can be applied in rules

## Firewall Logs

![Alt text](./assets/firewall%20log.PNG)

* Firewalls can be used for monitoring
* They can be configured to log entries for network traffic.
* The logs can be opened and later examined.

## Kahoot Review

Scrambling data into an unreadable format is encryption

Applocker each app must have its ownrule with is not true.

what is not an available APPlocker rule condition, which is File Name
